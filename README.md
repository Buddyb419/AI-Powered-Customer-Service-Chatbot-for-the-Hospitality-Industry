# AI-Powered Customer Service Chatbot for the Hospitality Industry

## Business Problem
Hotels and hospitality businesses frequently handle a high volume of repetitive customer inquiries regarding amenities, policies, and local attractions. Manually answering these common questions ties up front-desk staff, leading to slower response times for guests and preventing staff from focusing on more complex, high-value guest interactions. This inefficiency can negatively impact the overall customer experience.

## Solution Overview
This project addresses the challenge by developing a practical and user-centric chatbot for the "Triple Peaks Hotel." The chatbot acts as an instant, 24/7 virtual concierge, providing immediate and accurate answers to frequently asked questions. By leveraging a curated FAQ document as its knowledge base, the bot can handle a wide range of inquiries—from "What time is check-out?" to "Do you have a pool?"—without human intervention, significantly improving operational efficiency and guest satisfaction.

## Tools Used
* **Zapier:** The low-code platform used to design, build, and deploy the chatbot.
* **FAQ Document:** Served as the foundational knowledge base, enabling the chatbot to provide grounded, accurate responses based on the hotel's specific information.
* **AI & NLP:** The underlying technologies within Zapier that allow the chatbot to understand natural language questions and match them to the correct answers in its knowledge base.
